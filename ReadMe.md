    - Snake Head

    - SnakeBody

  - Food

## GameLink

The gamelink : <https://jamesdai05.github.io/SnakeGame/index.html>

## Installation instructions

The game is just a web-game and no installation is required

### Unsolved Problems

- Browser responsive design

## Items to be improved

- User Interface of the game , pause, restart buttons can be added.
